The Acquisition

A contact page / form that also invites the user to book a 30 minute consultation to find out how software can add value to them, we will charge £75 for this. We could brand it ‘the consultant challenge’ for example. Our frontline sales force will sell this, backed up by myself and others who will then ‘consult’.
